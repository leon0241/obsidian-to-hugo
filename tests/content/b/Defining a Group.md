> For any operation $\ast$, We say a non-empty set G is a *group* under $\ast$, or more formally that (G, $\ast$) is a group, if the following four axioms hold:
> - **G1 - Closure:** $\ast$ is a binary operation on G, that is $a\ast b \in G$ for all $a,b\in G$.
> - **G2 - Associativity:** $(a\ast b) \ast c =a\ast(b\ast c)$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
> - **G3 - Existence of identity:** There exists an *identity element* or *neutral element* of $G$ such that $e\ast g = g\ast e = e$ for all $g\in G$. 
> - **G4 - Existence of inverses:** Every element $g\in G$ has an *inverse* $g^{-1}$ such that $g\ast g^{-1}=g^{-1}\ast g = e$
