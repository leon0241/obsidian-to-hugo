> [!Example]+ Ex: [[Examples of a group|Addition under  Z]]> The integers $\Z = \{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots \}$ form a group under the operation $g\ast h = g+h$.> - **G1 - Closure:** $g+ h\in\Z$ for all $g,h\in\Z$ (infinite and countable)> - **G2 - Associativity:** $(g+h)+i=g+(h+i)$ for all $g,h,i\in\Z$> - **G3 - Identity:** There exists an integer $0$ such that $g + 0 = g$ for all $g\in\Z$> - **G4 - Inverses:** There exists an inverse $(-g)$ such that $(-g) + g = g + (-g)=0$ for all $g\in\Z$
> [!example]+ Ex: [[Examples of a group|Addition under N and N0]]> The natural numbers $\N = \{ 1,2,3,\dots \}$ and $\N_{0}=\{ 0,1,2,3,\dots  \}$ fail under the operation $g\ast h = g+h$.> - **G1 - Closure:** $g+ h\in\N$ for all $g,h\in\N$ (infinite and countable)> - **G2 - Associativity:** $(g+h)+i=g+(h+i)$ for all $g,h,i\in\Z$> - **G3 - Identity:** Fails! There exists **no** natural number $e$ such that $g + e = g$ for all $g\in\N$ ($0$ is not included in $\N$)> > **G1** - **G3** hold for the set $\N_{0}$, as there exists an identity element $0$ such that $g+0=g$, but **G4** fails since there is no inverse where $g^{-1} + g = g + g^{-1} = 0$
> [!example]+ Ex: [[Examples of a group|Multiplication under Z and Q]]> - The set $\Q$ fails under the operation $g\ast h = g\times h$. **G1** - **G3** hold, with identity element $1$, but there is no inverse element for $0$ where $0 \times 0^{-1}=1$. On the other hand, $(\Q\backslash\{ 0 \},\times)$ is a valid group (Rational numbers excluding $0$) since the edge case is removed, all other numbers have an inverse> - A similar argument can be said for $\Z$ under multiplication, but **G4** fails regardless of if $0$ is excluded or not. For example the only possible inverse of $2$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, but that is not an integer. The only elements of $(\Z\backslash\{ 0 \},\times )$ that have an inverse are $\{1,-1\}$
