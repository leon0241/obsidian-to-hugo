###### [[Abelian Group]]

> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Abelian Group]]
> 
> The definition of a group doesn't require that $a\ast b = b\ast a$.
> We say that a group is *abelian* or *commutative* if $a\ast b = b\ast a$ for every $a,b\in G$. If $a,b\in G$ are sucsh that $a\ast b = b\ast a$ we say that $a$ *commutes* with $b$ or that $a$ and $b$ *commute*

#### [[Abelian Group|Label]]

> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Abelian Group 2]]
> 
> The definition of abelian doesn't include this second definition as it is just for testing

##### Include this header as it is a smaller number
